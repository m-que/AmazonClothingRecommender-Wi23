# COGS118A Project template
This is my final group project from an undergraduate machine learning course at UC San Diego.

This project focused on a dataset of Amazon reviews for women's clothing. The project aimed to build a model that classifies customer reviews into clothing categories to recommend a specific class of apparel to Amazon customers. Various machine learning classifier algorithms were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, and Random Forest.
